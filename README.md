# Hedge System Frontend

This repository contains the React-based frontend for the Hedge System. It provides forms to run PnL simulations and retrieve hedging recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm. Any recent LTS version (e.g. Node 18) should work.

## Installation

Install the dependencies at the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the application

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This starts the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watches for code changes.

## Running tests

```

This launches the interactive test runner provided by Create React App.
